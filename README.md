# Own Your Rights

Own Your Rights is a Ruby on Rails application designed to train users in feeling confident about immigrants' rights in interactions with ICE agents. The app can be used by both immigrants and allies to imagine different scenarios they may encounter and how they can best respond to those scenarios. 

Own Your Rights is currently under development, but we look forward to being live soon!

## Features: 

A user is presented with multiple choice questions.
When a user answers a question, they are told whether or not their answer is correct.
If the answer is incorrect, the user is shown the answer, and the question is presented again later on to reinforce how best to respond to the given situation. 
If the answer is correct, the user will no longer see the question during their current session.
